## Abstract

This research presents a method for forecasting algal blooms using remote sensing with spatially and temporally sparse satellite data. The method involves the use of multiple interpolation methods to interpolate the sparse input data. The approach is shown to be effective in predicting algal blooms in areas where data is sparse, and the results demonstrate the potential for using this method to improve the forecasting and management of harmful algal blooms.
